This project is my attempt at creating a program that can fully read/edit/create every 
aspect of the exported/imported character sav file from the infamous Quest For Glory
series.

I originally begun the concept in 1995 as an alternative to saving my characters on 
a floppy disk, but severely lacked the skills neccessary, so the idea sat shelved 
since 1998.

It wasn't until I came across Adam Plocher's QfgCharacterEditor on github 
(https://github.com/aplocher), and his success in decoding the files for QFG1 and 
QFG2 that it reignited my passion to fully explore the sav files.

With that desire in mind, I have identified almost 100% of the QFG1 file (with the
exception of a single bit), and am eager to begin work on QFG2, then 3 and 4.

The GUI is very rough around the edges, but as my goal is fully exploring the contents
of the sav files, I'm okay with that.
