Quest For Glory 3: Byte Breakdown

QFG3 is different from QFG1 or QFG2 in a subtle but significant way.
Instead of each value being one byte (as in the previous two games),
each value is stored in two bytes.

Encryption Summary:
	The data portion of the Saved Character is 208 characters long, and is the ascii representation of the hex values. Each byte is represented by 2 characters (0 - f).
	The compression scheme follows this convention:
	Encrypted(N) = Short(N) XOR Short(N-1) with Short(-1) == 0x53
	
	Then the Encrypted value is split into two bytes AA BB as follows:
	AA(N) = Encrypted(N) / 100
	BB(N) = Encrypted(N) MOD 100

	i.e. The first byte is the value divided by 100, and the second byte is the remainder.

This causes a problem in *some* QFG3 games, and many more QFG4 games, when you 
have values larger than 10,000 (most likely experience).

(From CC:
Quest for Glory 5 has a similar problem with importing certain QG4 (and a very few QG3) files.  
The problem is that the export data was output as a series of ASCII values using the "%2x%2x" formatting 
string (number divided by 100 and remainder thereof) on the assumption that the values would 
never exceed 10000.  
Unfortunately, between the facts that stats could get up to 400 and there were more stats in QG4 
than in earlier games in the series, this sometimes overflowed yielding 5 digits instead of 4, and 
sometimes went negative (when the values exceeded 32767).
It's a big mess.)

NOTE: Because of the overflow error possibility, you cannot take the below positions for granted.  I do not have a method yet for parsing 
sav files that have overflow errors.
	
Short 0: Character Class 
    (0 for Fighter, 1 for Magic User, 2 for Thief, 3 for Paladin)
    
Shorts 1 and 2: Royals
	Short 1: currency / 100
	Short 2: remainder
	100 commons are automatically converted to royals, but anything less than 100 commons is discarded
	note: royals are saved at the end of QFG3, but that value is ignored for the start of QFG4.
    
Short 3: Unique Inventory Items
	bit  0: Dispell Potion
	bit  1: Tinderbox
	bit  2: Sapphire pin
	bit  3: Fine Dagger
	bit  4: Waterskin
	bit  5: Fake Black Bird (Tarna Junk Shop)
	bit  6: Event: Turned Baba Yaga into a frog in Spielburg
	bit  7: Rope
	but  8: Thieves Tool Kit
	bit  9: Sword
	bit 10: Shield (only if Fighter)
	bit 11: (unused)
	bit 12: (unused)
	bit 13: (unused)
	bit 14: (unused)
	bit 15: (unused)
	Note: bit 6 is a little ambiguous. The value is different depending on it the character was imported from QFG1 or from QFG2, 
	however I see no way of determining which game it was *actually* imported from.
	If imported from QFG1, this flag is enabled if the Hero turned Baba Yaga into a frog.
	If imported form QFG2, this flag is enabled if the Hero has both the EOF badge, and the X-Ray Glasses. (why is that useful??)
	Note2: When QFG4 imports, it makes the same check on QFG2 exports. If the Hero has the EOF Badge *and* the X-Ray Glasses, 
			it sets the same flag as if the hero turned Baba Yaga into a frog.
			It's possible there was a programming bug introduced in QFG2 where they were *supposed* to track that separately, but programmed
			it incorrectly, and then had to support that through the remaining games in the series


Shorts 4 - 18: Abilities and Skills 
    (4 - Strength, 5 - Intelligence, ... , 16 - Magic, 17 - Communication, 18 - Honor)
	NOTE: Paladin points are not saved, as they are a direct correlation with Honor

Short 19: Experience
    value is exp 
	NOTE: This is the most likely place for an overflow
    
Shorts 20 - 22: HP/SP/MP Current Levels
    Short 20: Health Points 
       (health is 1:1, i.e. 43HP = 43) 
       value is hp
    
    Short 21: Stamina Points
       (stamina is 1:1, i.e. 60SP = 60)
       value is sp
    
    Short 22: Magic Points
       (stamina is 1:1, i.e. 5MP = 5)
	   value is mp 
    
Shorts 23 - 36: Magic Spells
    (23 - Open, ... , 30 - Fetch, 31 - ForceBolt, 32 - Levitate, 33 - Reversal, 34 - Juggling Lights, 35 - Summon Staff, 36 - Lightning Ball)

Shorts 44 and 45: (constants)
    (Byte44 = 0x0019)
    (Byte45 = 0x00BE)
    
Shorts 46 and 47: Checksums
    (Byte46 is sum of all even bytes 0 - 42)
    (Byte47 is sum of all odd bytes 1 - 43)
    
Shorts 48 - 51: (constants)
    (Byte48 = 0x0037)
