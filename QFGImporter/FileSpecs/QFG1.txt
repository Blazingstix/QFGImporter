Quest For Glory 1: Byte Breakdown

Encryption Summary:
	The data portion of the Saved Character is 86 characters long, and is the ascii representation of the hex values. Each byte is represented by 2 characters (0 - f).
	The compression scheme follows this convention:
	EncryptedByte(N) = Byte(N) XOR Byte(N-1) with Byte(-1) == 0x53
	
Notes:
     There is no record of Shields (must be class-based, or linked with Sword)
     There is no record of leather armor (Ego is issued at least leather armor)
    
Byte 0: Character Class 
    (0 for Fighter, 1 for Magic User, 2 for Thief)
    (If Character class is set to 3, QFG 2 will import the character as a Paladin.
    I do not know if this causes any bugs throughout the game, but it's a cool tidbit.)
    
Bytes 1 and 2: Gold
    (Byte1 - 1) * 100 = The hundreds column of gold.
    (Byte2) = The remainder of gold.
    (Note, silver coins are automatically converted to gold at the end of QFG1, rounded down.
    (i.e. 9909 silver coins == 990 gold coins.)
    i.e. if Ego has 75 gold coins, Byte1 = 1, Byte2 = 75
        if Ego has 150 gold coins, Byte1 = 2, Byte2 = 50
        if Ego has 1031 gold coins, Byte1 = 11, Byte2 = 31
