Quest For Glory 2: Byte Breakdown

Encryption Summary:
	The data portion of the Saved Character is 96 characters long, and is the ascii representation of the hex values. Each byte is represented by 2 characters (0 - f).
	The compression scheme follows this convention:
	EncryptedByte(N) = Byte(N) XOR Byte(N-1) with Byte(-1) == 0x53
	
Byte 0: Character Class 
    (0 for Fighter, 1 for Magic User, 2 for Thief, 3 for Paladin)
    
Bytes 1 and 2: Dinars
    (Byte1) * 100 = The hundreds column of dinars.
    (Byte2) = The remainder of dinars.
    (Note, centimes are automatically converted to dinars at the end of QFG2, rounded down.
    (i.e. 9999 centimes == 99 dinars.)
    i.e. if Ego has 75 dinars, Byte1 = 0, Byte2 = 75
        if Ego has 150 dinars, Byte1 = 1, Byte2 = 50
        if Ego has 1031 dinars, Byte1 = 10, Byte2 = 31
	note: dinars are saved at the end of QFG2, but that value is ignored for the start of QFG3.
    
Byte 3: Puzzle Points 
	value is puzpoints AND 0xFF
    
Byte 4: Unique Inventory Items
    bit 0: Fine Sword
    bit 1: Soulforge (Rakeesh's Paladin Sword)
    bit 2: Saphirre Pin (gift from the Kattas)
    bit 3: Brass Lamp
    bit 4: EOF Badge
    bit 5: X-Ray Glasses
    bit 6: Broadsword
    bit 7: Chainmail
    note: the lock pick, theif's toolkit, and thieves' guild license are not saved in the character file
    note2: having the Compass counts as both bits 0 and 1, so ultimately distinguishing 
		   between having the fine sword or soulforge must depend on Class.

    (5 - Strength, 6 - Intelligence, ... , 17 - Magic, 18 - Communication, 19 - Honor)

Byte 20: Experience
    value is exp AND 0xFF
    
Bytes 21 - 23: HP/SP/MP Current Levels
    Byte 21: Health Points

       value is hp AND 0xFF
    
    Byte 22: Stamina Points
       (stamina is divided by 4, i.e. 15SP = 60)
       value is sp AND 0xFF
    
    Byte 23: Magic Points
       value is mp AND 0xFF
    
Bytes 24 - 34: Magic Spells

    (Byte40 = 0xA0)
    (Byte41 = 0x3E)
    
Bytes 42 and 43: Checksums
    (Byte42 is sum of all even bytes 0 - 39)
    (Byte43 is sum of all odd bytes 1 - 38)
    
Bytes 44 - 47: (constants - unknown)
    (Byte44 = 0x2F)
    (Byte45 = 0x90)
    (Byte46 = 0x19)
    (Byte47 = 0xA3)
