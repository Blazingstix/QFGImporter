Quest For Glory 4: Byte Breakdown

QFG4 is different from QFG1 or QFG2 in a subtle but significant way.
Instead of each value being one byte (as in the previous two games),
each value is stored in two bytes.

Encryption Summary:
	The data portion of the Saved Character is XXX characters long, and is the ascii representation of the hex values. Each byte is represented by 2 characters (0 - f).
	The compression scheme follows this convention:
	Encrypted(N) = Short(N) XOR Short(N-1) with Short(-1) == 0x53
	
	Then the Encrypted value is split into two bytes AA BB as follows:
	AA(N) = Encrypted(N) / 100
	BB(N) = Encrypted(N) MOD 100

	i.e. The first byte is the value divided by 100, and the second byte is the remainder.

This causes a problem in *some* QFG3 games, and many more QFG4 games, when you 
have values larger than 10,000 (most likely experience).

(From CC:
Quest for Glory 5 has a similar problem with importing certain QG4 (and a very few QG3) files.  
The problem is that the export data was output as a series of ASCII values using the "%2x%2x" formatting 
string (number divided by 100 and remainder thereof) on the assumption that the values would 
never exceed 10000.  
Unfortunately, between the facts that stats could get up to 400 and there were more stats in QG4 
than in earlier games in the series, this sometimes overflowed yielding 5 digits instead of 4, and 
sometimes went negative (when the values exceeded 32767).
It's a big mess.)

NOTE: Because of the overflow error possibility, you cannot take the below positions for granted.  I do not have a method yet for parsing 
sav files that have overflow errors.
	
Short 0: Character Class 
    (0 for Fighter, 1 for Magic User, 2 for Thief, 3 for Paladin)

	Short 2: remainder

Shorts 4 - 19: Abilities and Skills 
    (4 - Strength, 5 - Intelligence, ... , 16 - Magic, 17 - Communication, 18 - Honor, 19 - Acrobatics)

Short 20: Experience
    value is exp 
	NOTE: This is the most likely place for an overflow
    
Shorts 21 - 23: HP/SP/MP Current Levels
    Short 21: Health Points 
       (health is 1:1, i.e. 43HP = 43) 
       value is hp
    
    Short 22: Stamina Points
       (stamina is 1:1, i.e. 60SP = 60)
       value is sp
    
    Short 23: Magic Points
       (stamina is 1:1, i.e. 5MP = 5)
	   value is mp 
    
Shorts 24 - 44: Magic Spells
    (24 - Open, ... , 31 - Fetch, 32 - ForceBolt, 33 - Levitate, 34 - Reversal, 35 - Juggling Lights, 36 - Summon Staff, 37 - Lightning Ball)
	(38 - 44: Frost Bite, Ritual of Release, Hide, Aura, Protection, Resistance, Glide)
	(note: paladin spells are entirely dependent on Honor levels)
