Quest For Glory 4: Byte Breakdown

QFG4 is different from QFG1 or QFG2 in a subtle but significant way.
Instead of each value being one byte (as in the first two games),
each value is stored in two bytes.

Encryption Summary:
	The data portion of the Saved Character is 240 characters long, and is the ascii representation of the hex values. Each byte is represented by 2 characters (0 - f).
	The compression scheme follows this convention:
	Encrypted(N) = Short(N) XOR Short(N-1) with Short(-1) == 0x0053
	
	Then the Encrypted value is split into two bytes AA BB as follows:
	AA(N) = Encrypted(N) / 100
	BB(N) = Encrypted(N) MOD 100

	i.e. The first byte is the value divided by 100, and the second byte is the remainder.

This causes a problem in *some* QFG3 games, and many more QFG4 games, when you 
have values larger than 10,000 (most likely experience).

(From CC:
Quest for Glory 5 has a similar problem with importing certain QG4 (and a very few QG3) files.  
The problem is that the export data was output as a series of ASCII values using the "%2x%2x" formatting 
string (number divided by 100 and remainder thereof) on the assumption that the values would 
never exceed 10000.  
Unfortunately, between the facts that stats could get up to 400 and there were more stats in QG4 
than in earlier games in the series, this sometimes overflowed yielding 5 digits instead of 4, and 
sometimes went negative (when the values exceeded 32767).
It's a big mess.)

NOTE: Because of the overflow error possibility, you cannot take the below positions for granted.  I do not have a method yet for parsing 
sav files that have overflow errors.
	
Short 0: Character Class 
    (0 for Fighter, 1 for Magic User, 2 for Thief, 3 for Paladin)
    
Shorts 1 and 2: Crowns
	Short 1: crowns / 100
	Short 2: remainder
    
Short 3: Unique Inventory Items
	bit  0: (unused)
	bit  1: (unused)
	bit  2: (unused)
	bit  3: (unused)
	bit  4: Fake Black Bird (Tarna Junk Shop)
	bit  5: Fake Black Bird (Mordavia Monastery)
	bit  6: (unused)
	bit  7: (unused)
	but  8: (unused)

	bit 11: (unused)
	bit 12: (unused)
	bit 13: (unused)
	bit 14: (unused)
	bit 15: (unused)
	note: all 16 bits are allocated, however in a disappointing turn, only two flags are actually used.
	And no reference to the Sapphire Pin from QFG2 is present.

    (note: In another disappointing move, none of the inventory values above are actually saved when exporting at the end of QFG4.
            Their intended functions are derived from source code recreation efforts (following the same pattern from QFG3), but are not official.)
