Quest For Glory 2: Byte Breakdown

Encryption Summary:
	The data portion of the Saved Character is 96 characters long, and is the ascii representation of the hex values. Each byte is represented by 2 characters (0 - f).
	The compression scheme follows this convention:
	EncryptedByte(N) = Byte(N) XOR Byte(N-1) with Byte(-1) == 0x53
	
Byte 0: Character Class 
    (0 for Fighter, 1 for Magic User, 2 for Thief, 3 for Paladin)
    
Bytes 1 and 2: Dinars
    (Byte1) * 100 = The hundreds column of dinars.
    (Byte2) = The remainder of dinars.
    (Note, centimes are automatically converted to dinars at the end of QFG2, rounded down.
    (i.e. 9999 centimes == 99 dinars.)
    i.e. if Ego has 75 dinars, Byte1 = 0, Byte2 = 75
        if Ego has 150 dinars, Byte1 = 1, Byte2 = 50
        if Ego has 1031 dinars, Byte1 = 10, Byte2 = 31
	note: dinars are saved at the end of QFG2, but that value is ignored for the start of QFG3.
    
Byte 3: Puzzle Points 
	value is puzpoints AND 0xFF
    
Byte 4: Unique Inventory Items
    bit 0: Fine Sword
    bit 1: Soulforge (Rakeesh's Paladin Sword)
    bit 2: Saphirre Pin (gift from the Kattas)
    bit 3: Brass Lamp
    bit 4: EOF Badge
    bit 5: X-Ray Glasses
    bit 6: Broadsword
    bit 7: Chainmail
    note: the lock pick, theif's toolkit, and thieves' guild license are not saved in the character file
    note2: having the Compass counts as both bits 0 and 1, so ultimately distinguishing 
		   between having the fine sword or soulforge must depend on Class.
	note3: There is likely a programming bug involving the EOF Badge and the X-Ray Glasses. 
		   Later games (QFG3/QFG4) took steps to use having both the EOF Badge and the X-Ray glasses
		   as an indicator that you turned Baba Yaga into a frog in Spielburg.
		   (Interestingly, even though QFG4 read in that information, it ultimately did nothing with it, 
		   and the story progresssed under the assumption you *did* turn her into a frog).
